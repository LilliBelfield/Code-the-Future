### Sarah

I joined IBM CIC as a graduate in 2016. Before IBM I studied and worked in Animal Behaviour,
Conservation and Engineering. It annoyed me that there was no software out there to help in
my fish conservation research so I took a free evening course (much like this one!) to see if
it was possible to learn to code and build the software that I needed. Soon after, I met someone
from IBM CIC who suggested I apply because I showed enthusiasm and knew enough of the basics -
they would teach me everything else I needed to know. I'm now a Managing Developer and Development Lead for two dev
teams and I love my job.

### Vivienne

I joined IBM CIC as an associate in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied in the field of research in Applied Mathematics and Computational Modelling. After completing a year as a PhD student, I decided I wanted to explore a different aspect of programming. I applied for the Application Developer role at IBM and never expected to get it! Although I had some programming skills, I knew nothing about software development... Luckily, this role included 9 weeks of developer training and, although I have only been in this role for a short amount of time, I am really enjoying it. I am very much still new to the development world and am learning more and more every day at IBM.

### Georgia

After finishing my A Levels I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a career. I looked at different University
options and the Computer Science course caught my eye. That was where I created my first programme (in C)
and I was hooked from there. Now I have worked for IBM CIC since 2018 and been given the opportunity to work
as a full stack Developer and Scrum Master. I enjoy the variation of tasks I get in my role, that I am able
to keep learning during my role and how no two weeks are the same!

### Kristel

I joined IBM CIC as a Developer in March 2021. I started my career as a functional consultant and worked with various proprietary software. I wanted more hands-on experience creating applications from "scratch" and not to get tied down to a single architecture/platform. I switched to full stack development, building bespoke applications both in and outside of work, where I quickly developed my technical knowledge and skills over the years. I am enjoying the variety of work at my current role and looking forward to the numerous possibilities of career growth that IBM has to offer.

### Remya

After my computer science engineering degree I started my career as a server administrator. I switched my career to a developer a few years later and have been one for the past 7 years. I am currently a full stack developer. I joined IBM CIC in May 2021. I enjoy code development and look forward to learning new technologies in my role in IBM.

### Henry

I joined IBM as an Associate Developer in February 2021. Before IBM, I studied Economics at the University of Exeter with the aim of working in ethical finance. I took a job at Monzo Bank but quickly realised that I wanted to be a developer, designing the amazing tools I was using to help millions of people. So I enrolled on an MSc conversion course in Computer Science at Birkbeck University and applied for a role here at IBM. I'm already loving the job which, most importantly, gives me almost unlimited scope for creativity and many oportunities to contribute to the causes I care about.

### Samuel

I joined IBM in February 2021 as an Associate Developer. Before joining IBM I studied artificial intelligence, with a focus on autonomous robotics, wanting to create robots that could help people and make their lives easier. I really enjoy the work I do here, creatively problem solving on tools that will make peoples lives easier. I'm currently training in new tools to move my career towards artificical intelligence research, as that's where I believe I can best help.

### Aum

Hola! I joined IBM CIC in June 2021 as a graduate. I studied Computer Science with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Kent. Even though it's been a short period in my current role, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working at IBM due to the vast amount of self growth opportunities and the constant learning experiences IBM provides.

### Lilli

I joined IBM CIC in August 2015 on a 6 month contract as an intern in the recruitment team after completing my LLB in Law at University of Leicester. What I expected to be a short term role to gain expeirence turned into a great career thanks to the opportunities I've been given at IBM CIC. Within the last (nearly) 7 years I've progressed from my original role as a recruitment intern, into a recruitment co-ordinator, recruiter, and then recruitment partner. I then decided I wanted to do something new and IBM supported me by funding my CIPD certification and giving me the opportunity to work within the HR Team. Within this team I've progressed from HR Partner Support into a HR Partner Role. My role as HR Partner involves supporting the HR processes for all of our CIC North employees, plus I look after some strategy areas for the whole of CIC UK such as Diversity and Inclusion. As part of my role I get to create and run awesome schemes like this Learn to Code the Future course. My career journey and skills aren't particularly relevant to aspiring techies (like yourself) but I hpoe my bio has shown you the amazing career opportunities we have at IBM CIC and this course may be your first step on that journey.
